They are those Rifians. Berbers by race, who have no law beyond their guns, and recognize no authority. Audacious pirates, sanguinary bandits. eternal rebels, who inhabit the mountains of the coast of Tetuan, on the Algerian frontier, whom neither the cannon of European ships nor the armies of the Sultan have ever been able to dislodge; the population, in short, of that famous Rif, where no foreigner may dare to set his foot, unless under the protection of the saints and the sheikhs; about whom all sorts of terrible legends are rife; and the neighboring peoples speak vaguely of their country, as of one far distant and unknown. They are often seen in Tangiers. They are tall and robust men, dressed in dark mantles, bordered with various colors. Some have their faces ornamented with yellow arabesques. All are armed with very long guns, whose red cases they twist about their heads like turbans; and they go in companies, speaking low, and looking about them from under their brows, like bravoes in search of a victim. In comparison with them, the wildest Arab seems a lifelong friend.

        <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 first-line:uppercase first-line:tracking-widest first-letter:text-7xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-gray-900 dark:first-letter:text-gray-100 first-letter:mr-3 first-letter:float-left w-4/5 mx-auto mt-8">On landing about two years ago at Tangier, I began to remark, about the market places, lightly clad, sun burnt figures, with heads shaved, all but one occipital corner, where a tuft of hair was allowed to develop into a long tress, which was worn either plaited or flowing luxuriantly and unconfined, like an animal’s tail. “ Who are these men ?” I asked my interpreter. “ Bery bad men, sir !—suppose you want to kill me—then you give one of these men a penny—one penny —and he will do it.”
        These wild relatives or descendants of the Ryf pirates of other days are the inhabitants of the northern spurs of the Atlas range which separate Morocco from Algeria; and, though they are nominally the subjects of the Sultan of Morocco, they never have been really subdued in their mountain fastnesses. They are very jealous of any violation of their territory, and for a stranger to attempt to pass through these mountain ranges is said to be certain death. Al-Ryf, however, are by no means confined to these inaccessible and inhospitable regions. The entire Tangier district is reckoned to be Ryf territory, and what little agriculture goes on is in the hands of Al-Ryf But this province is by no means one of the most fertile in Morocco. Many of these people are also shopkeepers in the towns, practise handicrafts, and occupy themselves in commercial pursuits. The present Basha of Tangier is a Ryfy (Ryf-man). Like all the fair people of Morocco, Al-Ryf are a handsome and well-formed generation. When they are constantly exposed to the sun, their skin takes on a magnificent bronze colour ; but those who follow indoor pursuits are of a delicate olive complexion.

        more or less in conformity with Riffian ideas of
        morality and decorum. They enjoy practical joking and general jollification, but do not indulge in the hashish smoking and sodomy practiced by students from the Jebala, who
        bring with them boys ostensibly serving as musical apprentices. Before European occupa-
        tion, these western students did not meet with a warm reception in the Rif. They were fre-
        quently refused entrance to some districts. In others, so many jokes were played upon
        them that they left hurriedly and never returned.
        On one occasion, Jebalan students entered the mosque in a canton of the Gzennaya, leav-
        ing outside a mule which they had brought with them. They asked for food, and ate more
        than was thought necessary by the men who provided it. When they asked for more food,
        one of the men went outside, cut a slice of meat from the mule’s rump, cooked it, and then
        brought it in. The students ate it. One of them, going outside to feed the mule, found its
        condition, whereupon the students left immediately, and few of their type have come there since.
        Since European occupation, the Riffians have been prevented from excluding the students of the Jebala by such rigorous means. At present many of these undesirables are
        found in the Rif, to the consternation of the powerless inhabitants, who fear that they will
        spread their vicious practices among the younger generation.
